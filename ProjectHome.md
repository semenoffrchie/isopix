Isopix is a Isometric Image Generation engine, coded in PHP. It allows dynamic generation of 'Isometric' images using the PHP-GD library.

Isopix can generate isometric and diametric images, but is configured by default to produce diametric. (There is no real difference...)

Isopix is released under a GNU General Public Licence (v2.0) and is currently maintained by Peter Corcoran (DrewMOO) and David Kendal (davidpk212).
With help from Joe Love (joe.love) and Figlesquidge.

Isopix was first released on the 1st of January 2007, and is currently in BETA.

The downloads section is not actively maintained at the moment, but is periodically updated.
For the latest version, please see the SVN.
